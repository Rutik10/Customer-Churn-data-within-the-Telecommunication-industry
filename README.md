# Customer-Churn-data-within-the-Telecommunication-industry


Churn rate is a critical metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rates mean happy customers; high
churn rates mean customers are leaving you. A small rate of monthly/quarterly churn compounds over
time. 1% monthly churn quickly translates to almost 12% yearly churn

It is very common for companies to focus energy on combating customer churn, but the reality is that
once they’ve identified a customer who is about to leave, it’s often too late to entice them to stay.
The key is to identify customers at risk of churn early, before they get too far down the path, and to take
preemptive action to retain them and improve the customer relationship.

This is where Advanced Analytics (Machine Learning and Deep Learning modeling) comes into play.
Using Data Science and AI approaches to predict which of the customers will be loyal and which will lapse.
ML model(s) will help the company’s executives to understand what makes a great or bad customer
so they can take action.

Teaching machines to predict customer behavior, and communicate which customer attributes predict
specific behaviors, allows management to help build an organizational playbook for acquiring and keeping
happy customers. For example, a client success organization can reach out before there's a problem, their
marketing department can reach new customers that are less likely to churn, and their sales organization
can bring these better customers on board.

This problem is a typical classification task. build Machine Learning models to predict whether
a customer will churn or not.

BEFORE applying ML modeling to the data, we perform Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA).

We are asked to perform two (2) stages of analysis, based on different distribution of data:
1- Fit your models on the original (given) dataset
2- Fit your models on the modified dataset, after applying the SMOTE technique.
The Machine Learning models to be used are:
 Naïve Bayes
 Logistic Regression
 Random Forests
 XGBoost


The metrics of performance of the chosen models are:-, with huge emphasis to recall:
 Accuracy
 Precision
 Recall
 F1-Score
